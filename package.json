  "description": "You are required to build a blogging api. The general idea here is that the api has a\r general endpoint that shows a list of articles that have been created by different people,\r and anybody that calls this endpoint, should be able to read a blog created by them or\r other users.\r Requirements\r 1. Users should have a first_name, last_name, email, password, (you can add other\r attributes you want to store about the user)\r 2. A user should be able to sign up and sign in into the blog app\r 3. Use JWT as authentication strategy and expire the token after 1 hour\r 4. A blog can be in two states; draft and published\r 5. Logged in and not logged in users should be able to get a list of published blogs\r created\r 6. Logged in and not logged in users should be able to to get a published blog\r 7. Logged in users should be able to create a blog.\r 8. When a blog is created, it is in draft state\r 9. The owner of the blog should be able to update the state of the blog to published\r 10. The owner of a blog should be able to edit the blog in draft or published state\r 11. The owner of the blog should be able to delete the blog in draft or published\r state\r 12.The owner of the blog should be able to get a list of their blogs.\r a. The endpoint should be paginated\r b. It should be filterable by state\r 13.Blogs created should have title, description, tags, author, timestamp, state,\r read_count, reading_time and body.\r 14.The list of blogs endpoint that can be accessed by both logged in and not logged\r in users should be paginated,\r a. default it to 20 blogs per page.",
